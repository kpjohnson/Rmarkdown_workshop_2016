```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
    # set global options for R code chunks: echo=FALSE (don't include source code); 
    # warning=FALSE (suppress R warnings); message=FALSE (suppress R messages)
    # eval = TRUE is default
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

      library(xtable)
      options(xtable.comment = FALSE)  # turns off xtable comments
```

Change some of the YAML settings to see what happens.

Notice, the down arrow at line 22.  If you click this, you can hide the R code chunk.  This is helpful when working through a large document.

On the right side of the R code chunk are additional options, Settings, a down arrow (run previous R code chunks), and a green play button (runs the current chunk).  It's handy to check R code chunks as you go and to debug.  Within the Assessment template, this is also the only way to see variables in your Environment.

#Figure from a file
You can use any file extension, including PDFs

![Here's my caption \label{fig:fig_example}](RMarkdownFLow.png)

![Here's my caption 2\label{fig:fig_example}](./Figures/RMarkdownFLow1.png)

Figures are referenced using LaTeX syntax \ref{fig:fig_example}.

Put a space between the ] and ( above. Knit the document.  


Now try adding your own picture to the directory, adding it in here, and referencing it.



# R code chunks

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


Play witht the r code chunk options, echo=TRUE, include=FALSE, results='asis'

# Figure from R code chunk

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, fig.cap="Figure of something  at $40^\\circ 10^\\prime$. \\label{fig:pressure}"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note, you need extra \\s when using LaTeX syntax within an R code chunk, or when inserting a backslash in R markdown.  The same goes with percent signs and any other LaTeX reserved symbol. You can use a % in line without dollar signs, if in math mode you need dollar signs. ex: $\%$


This is inline math mode for Latex $40^\circ 10^\prime$


We can now reference Figure \ref{fig:pressure}.  Note where this text ends up.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Tables

```{r, results='asis'}
#, results='asis', echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE
Tab = read.csv('Table_example.csv')

Tab_example = xtable(Tab, 
                   caption=c('This is where you write your caption'),
                   label = 'tab:Table_example')

print(Tab_example, include.rownames = FALSE, caption.placement = 'top', scalebox=.7)

# Use subargument digits=how ever many digits you want to give it and it will apply this
# to the entire table; you can give the digits subargument a vector and give it a zero for columns
# like years! yay.

# Arni trick: use vector of the data that uses an argument to count the digits and then use an if statement to tell it what to give digits...I think

# print option to try, scalebox = 0.7
# add alignment
align(Tab_example) = "lcrcrcrcrcrl"

# you'll always need ncol + 1 cuz it includes rownames

# If latex can't find a table you call it will place ?? where the table should go so you can ctrl find errors


```



Try changing the R chunk options above. 

We can now reference Table \ref{tab:Table_example}.

Now, try putting the R code chunk within and HTML comment.



# Create you own table
Either create a .csv file or copy one into the repo folder on your computer.

Now, create a table!
```{r, results='asis'}
Tab2 = read.csv("admb_tshirts.csv")

Tab_example2 = xtable(Tab2, 
                      caption=c("This is da caption."),
                      label="tab:Table_example2")

print(Tab_example2, include.rownames = FALSE, caption.placement = 'top', scalebox=.7)

```

#Math mode

You can use LaTeX math mode both inline and for inserting equations. It's handy for using inline math mode for management measure and lat/long.

Inline looks like this:  $SPR_{40\%}$  
*Note the % sign has a \ when used in math mode, but not in R markdown text.

To get degrees and minutes type: $40^\circ 10^\prime$
